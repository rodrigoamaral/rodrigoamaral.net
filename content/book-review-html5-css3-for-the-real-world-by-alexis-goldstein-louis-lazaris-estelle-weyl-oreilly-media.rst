The purpose of `HTML5 & CSS3 for the Real World <http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780980846904.do>`__, as
title says, is to help the readers face real world problems of website
building process, giving practical instruction on the new HTML5 and CSS3
resources involved in each specific need. The strong semantic nature of
HTML5 specification is highly emphasized, making the reader think about
all the possibilites of a truly semantic web. Also, the book offers a
fairly deep historic background of the evolution of the specs.

HTML5 new tags are discussed in detail, including examples of some
common use scenarios. Also, there is a small website project to follow
as an example. People who is really serious about learn and understand
details should try to code it from scratch. The section about CSS
selectors, for example, gives a formal and in-depth coverage of the
subject. It becomes easier to understand what you are doing when
creating your style sheets if you know how to categorize the different
selectors. Chapter 6 brings a section on CSS colors that enlightened me
on basic aspects of color composition and perception.

In case you want to get up to speed quickly, I think it's ok to just
skim over chapter 1, if you're not interested in HTML/CSS historic
details, and chapter 5, if you don't need to work with audio, video and
multimedia resources right away.

The only thing that could be a downside for some people is the fact that
much of the valuable and comprehensive information you find in the book
is written in prose, not structured by topics. So, if you want a mere
reference book, maybe this one is not for you.

I don't now if `HTML5 & CSS3 for the Real
World <http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780980846904.do>`__ surprised me
in a positive way because I'm not primarily a front-end developer - and
therefore was presented to new information that amazed me - but the fact
is that I didn't expect to read such a good book on the subject.
